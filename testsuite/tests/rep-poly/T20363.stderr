T20363.hs:23:10: error:
    • The newtype constructor pattern
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its kind is:
        TYPE NilRep
      (Use -fprint-explicit-coercions to see the full type.)
      NB: GHC does not (yet) support rewriting in runtime representations.
      Please comment on GHC ticket #13105 if this is causing you trouble.
      <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/13105>
    • In the pattern: MkNT (##)
      In an equation for ‘test1b’: test1b (MkNT (##)) = 0
