    • The function argument
        ‘42’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        Int :: TYPE (Id LiftedRep)
      NB: GHC does not (yet) support rewriting in runtime representations.
      Please comment on GHC ticket #13105 if this is causing you trouble.

    • In the first argument of ‘MkT’, namely ‘42’
      In the expression: MkT 42
