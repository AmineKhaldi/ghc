RepPolyBackpack1.bkp:17:5: error:
    The first pattern in the equation for ‘funcA’
    does not have a fixed runtime representation.
    Its type is:

RepPolyBackpack1.bkp:17:17: error:
    • The argument ‘x’ of ‘plus’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        Number l :: TYPE (Rep l)
    • In the expression: plus x (multiply x y)
      In an equation for ‘funcA’: funcA x y = plus x (multiply x y)
