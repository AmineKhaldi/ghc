    • The first pattern in the equation for ‘abst’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        Rep Int :: TYPE (RepRep Int)
      NB: GHC does not (yet) support rewriting in runtime representations.
      Please comment on GHC ticket #13105 if this is causing you trouble.
