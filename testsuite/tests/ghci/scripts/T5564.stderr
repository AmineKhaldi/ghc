<interactive>:2:1: error:
    Variable not in scope: git
    Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘it’ (line 1)

<interactive>:4:1: error:
    Variable not in scope: fit
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps use one of these:
        ‘Ghci1.it’ (imported from Ghci1), ‘it’ (line 3),
        ‘fst’ (imported from Prelude)
