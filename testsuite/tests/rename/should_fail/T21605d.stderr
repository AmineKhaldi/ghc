T21605d.hs:3:9: [GHC-37479]
    ‘Prelude.id’ is a term-level binding
     and can not be used at the type level.
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps use one of these:
        type constructor or class ‘Prelude.Eq’ (imported from Prelude),
        type constructor or class ‘Prelude.IO’ (imported from Prelude),
        type constructor or class ‘Prelude.Ord’ (imported from Prelude)
